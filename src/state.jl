## initialization

"""
    CUDA.prepare_cuda_call()

Prepare state for calling CUDA API functions.

Many CUDA APIs, like the CUDA driver API used by CUDA.jl, use implicit thread-local state
to determine, e.g., which device to use. With Julia however, code is grouped in tasks.
Execution can switch between them, and tasks can be executing on (and in the future migrate
between) different threads. To synchronize these two worlds, call this function before any
CUDA API call to update thread-local state based on the current task and its context.

If you need to maintain your own thread-local state, subscribe to context and task switch
events using [`CUDA.atcontextswitch`](@ref) and [`CUDA.attaskswitch`](@ref) for
proper invalidation.

for initial set-up of the environment. If you need to switch devices on a regular basis,
work with contexts instead and call [`context!`](@ref) directly (5-10ns).

add a hook using [`CUDA.atcontextswitch`](@ref).
